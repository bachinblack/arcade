# arcade
Epitech project: Intefaces and games library.
project group size: 3 peoples

As the name suggests, the Arcade project is an interfaces and games library.

If one executes the "arcade" file, it takes them to the menu, where they can pick a game out of 4 and an UI library out of 3.
The choice is made with the keys "Z-E" and "S-D".
The chosen game is played with the chosen interface, and the player can still switch between the games with the 2-3-4 keys (1 to go back to the menu).

I made the interface and the abstract class for a basic game.
I also made every games except for the pacman.
The games may contain bugs, but keep in mind that we had only a few weeks to make this project, along with several others :)

It works only under Linux and Some packages are required :
libsdl2-dev
libaa1-dev
opengl (can't remember package names)

Some screenshots are available to describe the project and its content. Feel free to take a look
