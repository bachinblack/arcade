# arcade
Epitech project: Intefaces and games library.
project group size: 3 peoples

As the name suggest, the Arcade project is an interfaces and games library.

If one execute the "arcade" file, it takes him to the menu, where he can chose a game out of 4 and an interface out of 3.
The choice is made with the keys "Z-E" and "S-D".
The chosen game is played with the chosen interface, and the player can still switch them with the 2 to 4 keys (1 to go back to the menu).

I made the interface and the abstract class for a basic game.
I also made every games except the pacman.
The games surely have a lot of bugs, but keep in mind that we had only a few weeks to make this project, along with several others.

It works only under Linux and Some packages are needed :
libsdl2-dev
libaa1-dev
opengl (can't remember packages names)

I may have forgotten some. If it's the case, i am sorry, and i would be happy to make the changes.

Some screenshots are available to describe the project and its content. Feel free to take a look
